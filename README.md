# Nomadika
   Nomadika is a travel companion for users to find the most recommended venues in any city on the globe! A user can access a feed tied to a specific location and ask questions or socialize with other users that want to interact on that feed. Users can get the name and address of recommended landmarks, restaurants, hotels, bars, and nightlife venues for a specific city. 
   
# Technoliges 
   Nomadika uses the foursqaure external api to tie venues to specific locations. The backend was created using Python/flask with SQLAlchemy ORM. For the frontend Nomadika uses Javascript and React/Redux. 
   
# Design 
   Nomadika was inspired by the current styling trends, specifically Neumorphism and Glassmorphism.
